# NET-RMSI_Bot
 
NET-RMSI_Bot is a clientside controller application for the NET-RMSI project.

Built to run on a wide range of server hardware through deployment with Docker, the main purpose of this program is to provide a controller client for a NET-RMSI_Server allowing commands to be issued from the user to control a connected NET_RMSI_Client attached to a physical server.

Documentation for NET-RMSI_Bot can be in the [Wiki](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Client/wiki) section of this repository.

***

Branch layout is as follows:
* [dev](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Client/tree/dev/) - Development branch, features are added often in stages and are not always fully functional as they get worked on, therefore making dev unsuitable for production.
* [stable](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Client/tree/stable/) - Current stable version of the software.
* [bleeding-edge](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Client/tree/bleeding-edge/) - Newest features with full functionality but may contain bugs.
* version-x.x.x - Legacy versions and codebases.
